Image Sequence for Scroll Animation

This directory contains WebP image frames (0001.webp through 0099.webp) used for 
scroll-triggered animation on Android devices.

The images are loaded sequentially based on scroll position, creating a smooth 
scrolling effect similar to the video version used on other devices.

These images are automatically used on Android devices instead of video for better 
performance and compatibility.
